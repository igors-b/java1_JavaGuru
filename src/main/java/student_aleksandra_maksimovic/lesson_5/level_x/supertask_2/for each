FOR EACH (ENHANCED) LOOP: SUMMARY
▸ For each loop, also known as enhanced loop, is another
way to traverse the array
▸ There is no use of the index or rather the counter variable
▸ Data type declared in the foreach must match the data
type of the array that you are iterating
▸ Can access only current element
▸ Significantly reduces amount of code

FOR EACH (ENHANCED) LOOP: CODE EXAMPLE

public class ForEachDemo {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         String[] dogBreeds = {
             "Beagle",
             "Golden Retriever",
             "Pug",
             "Shiba Inu"
         };
         for (String breed : dogBreeds) {
         System.out.println(breed);
         }
     }
}
