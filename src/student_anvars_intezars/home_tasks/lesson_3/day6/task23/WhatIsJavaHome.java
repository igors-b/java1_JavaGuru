    /*
    JAVA_HOME is a environment variable (in Unix terminologies),
     or a PATH variable (in Windows terminology).
     A lot of well behaving Java applications (which need the JDK/JRE) to run,
     looks up the JAVA_HOME variable for the location where the Java compiler/interpreter
     may be found.
     JAVA HOME is used for setting up the
     environment variable for JAVA.
     The JAVA_HOME environment variable needs to point to
     the installation directory on your system that contains the bin/ directory
     where the java executable physically resides, and the lib/ directory which
     contains the core java libraries and properties files. For linux users, it
     is almost certainly not the same directory that you get if you do "which java"
     from the command line, because that would be too easy. So if JAVA_HOME isn't already set,
     your next task is to find the directory to which you need to set it.
